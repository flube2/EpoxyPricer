- Download, install, test GitBash (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Generate SSH keys. Seeing as RSA is being deprecated, use EDCSA instead ("ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521" via CMD)
- Register SSH keys with GitHub (https://github.com/settings/keys)
- Open folder in Windows Explorer, right-click, click "Open GitBash Here"
- Tell git who you are by typing:
	 git config --global user.email "lubekfrankjaz@gmail.com"
	 git config --global user.name "Frank"
- Create new folder on desktop, rename with project name, open gitbash and type "git init"
- Upload repo to GitHub by typing:
	"git status" - to verify status, this is BY FAAAAAAAR my most used command and usually use after ANY/EVERY other command as a sanity check
	"git add [filename or * for all files]" - stage files
	"git commit -m [insert comment here]" - Tell git to add your staged files to memory
	"git remote add origin https://github.com/lubekfrankjaz/EpoxyPricer.git" - only ran once, tell git where you want your changes to go
	"git branch -M main" - sets branch, can fork path later
	"git push -u origin main" - push changes to my GitHub repo [aka save my changes]   // Note "master" is now "main" as somehow that's offensive and racist..... smh.
	
	At this point your GitBash can, is, has and will communicate with that GitHub repo via opening GitBash in current directory

// Make changes as needed, but when you want to save progress type:
	"git add *" adds all files in working directory, can exclude or select specific file by typing git add [filename] or git add * .[file extension]
	"git commit -m "[message about what you changed, should be informative]""
	"git push origin main"  - save your progress
	
// Note: Every push is registered and you can make directory look exactly like it did when you typed push command
Remember how back in the day with PS1 you'd save every 5 mins so you save progress, like save the game state in case things went south so you don't start from beginning?
This is same concept, you can change your files to look how they did whenever you pushed, so SAVE AFTER EVEN THE MOST MINOR CHANGES
If you don't, trust me, truuuuust me, you WILL regret not doing so at some point.
Like when I ran "rm -rf *.*" in wrong directory and over 100 hrs of work was gone in minutes, I was only able to recover because I saved after every change.


/////////////
// Purpose //
/////////////


I need a basic price calculator for the epoxy products created under the partnership agreement between Lubek Enterprises (LE) and James Baran.
The manufacturing process uses various resources that must be taken into account when determining prices of the final products.
As pricing the final products appropriately directly effects profits and more importantly, profit margins, consistency and accuracy are detrimental.
This project is being carried out to elimainate manual calculations that could potentially be effected by human error.


///////////////
// Resources //
///////////////


The resources involved are: 2-part epoxy mixture, basic color effects (liquid), glow in the dark solution and advanced effects (powders). [I will add to this as I go]
- The 2-part epoxy mixture is necessary as it's the base of each item. Without it there is no product.
- The basic color effects are liquids that are mixed in with the base in different ways, but primarily act as the main overall color for each product.
- The glow-in-the-dark solution is added to store and emit photons allowing the product to be seen in low-light environments.
- The advanced effects are typically powders that are mixed with the base to create visually appealing effects. Gold sparkles, blue streaks, etc.


////////////////////
// Objects Needed //
////////////////////


Product {
- Size (enum) - [Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge]   // Factors into amount of epoxy base solution needed, general (batch quantities)
- Weight - How much item weighs overall   // Factors into amount of epoxy base solution needed, accurate (individual)
- Basic Effect Level (enum) - [Hardly Any [1], Little [2], Medium [3], Lot [4], Tons [5]]
- Advanced Effect Level (enum) - [Hardly Any [1], Little [2], Medium [3], Lot [4], Tons [5]]
- Glow Level (enum) - [Little [1], Medium [2], Lot [3]]
- Extras (Map (Object, Price)) - Static cost add-on determined using component as a key and price as a value
